- I have loaded a number of classes from the cvs repository at org.eclipse.dev 
(HEAD stream).  Among them are org.eclipse.core.runtime and 
org.eclipse.core.boot
- Search-&gt;File
- fill in &quot;findResource(&quot; in the 'Containing Text' field
- leave everything else as default (searching the workspace and for file name 
patterns '*')
- do the search
- I get 2 hits:
DelegatingURLClassLoader.class 
(org.eclipse.core.boot/bin/org/eclipse/core/internal/boot) and
DelegatingURLClassLoader.java
(org.eclipse.core.boot/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/boot) - 10 matches

- try to open the first file in the search result (which doesn't really make 
sense since it is a .class file)
- you get the error:

Could not open the editor

Reason:
   bin/org/eclipse/core/internal/boot does not exist

- But it does exist and there is a DelegatingURLClassLoader.class there.
- Now try to redo the search
- Search-&gt;File
- in the 'Containing Text' field you find &quot;findResource(u67&quot; (i.e added 
garbage to the end of my search string).</column>
